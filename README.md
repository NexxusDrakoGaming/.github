## 📜 History

The Nexxus Drako name has a long history across the internet, growing from early web communities and indie game development under the alias **Jarokn** (and later **Nexxus Drako 313**) into the current unified brand.

Past projects have spanned cricket simulations, open scoreboards, Kerbal Space Program mods, Football Manager fantasy nations, and micronational governance in the **Vyktoryan Commonwealth**. The [Archive Project](https://github.com/NexxusDrakoGaming/Archive-Project) documents this history.
